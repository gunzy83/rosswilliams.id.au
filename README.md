To create and serve posts locally, only `docker-compose` is required.

To test the Github workflow, install `act` (see [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) for install instructions).

Usage
-----

The `Makefile` is set up with a few commands to support authoring and publishing testing. It is written to be self documenting, run `make` to see the help.
